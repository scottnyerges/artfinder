# artfinder
**ARTFINDER** is a mobile app designed to connect artists, collectors, and art lovers in Austin, Texas. In its full iteration, the app will contain a weekly guide to what's happening in the Austin arts community, as well as an online martketplace where artists can sell directly to collectors. A social component will invite creatives and arts lovers to connect and strengthen the Austin arts community.

This design mockup is a work in progress. The app's home page is rendered in this initial commit.
